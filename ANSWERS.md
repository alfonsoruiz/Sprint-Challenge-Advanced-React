- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
      We would use class components when we need to give a component state and access to lifecycle methods

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

  1. componentDidMount() is used to make api calls or preform DOM operations after all components have rendered to the screen.
  2. render() render handles the rendering of components to the UI druing mounting and updating phases of the react lifecycled.
  3. componentDidUpdate(); is used to make updates to the UI after a component has mounted.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      Custom hooks allow for the stateful logic of a component to be extracted in re-usable functions.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
      Testing allows bugs to be found gaster, Acts as documentation for the code and makes refactoring or adding features to an application just to name a few much easier to do than when no testing is done
